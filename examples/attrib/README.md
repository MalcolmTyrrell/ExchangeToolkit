# Example: `attrib`
This example loads the specified input file and iterates over all of the B-Rep faces and edges. This is the main usefulness of this example with respect to the Exchange Toolkit. It illustrates the ability to easily obtain all unique parts, and from those parts, obtain faces and finally edges.

The underlying goal of this example in B-Rep traversal, is to attach attributes containing points and directions of interest (such as end points, mid-points, etc) to those entities.


## Sample Usage
`attrib "_micro engine.CATProduct"`
